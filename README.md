# NicknameGenerator
Generates a nickname for you! 
  
[NicknameBot](https://github.com/gurj096/NicknameGenerator/blob/main/NicknameBot.py) is meant to be used in a discord server. 

[NicknameGenerator](https://github.com/gurj096/NicknameGenerator/blob/main/NicknameGenerator.py) can be used locally from a command line or IDE

[adjectives.yml](https://github.com/gurj096/NicknameGenerator/blob/main/adjectives.yml) is needed as the file houses the lists needed to generate nicknames

Adjective list was obtained from [here](https://gist.github.com/hugsy/8910dc78d208e40de42deb29e62df913) and was adapted into python list format
